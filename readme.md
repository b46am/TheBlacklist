# The Blacklist

## What is this repository?

Sometimes acts of injustice get overlooked by the legal system, either deliberately, accidentally, or due to the lack of an actual law addressing the issue. In such situations, the only way an ordinary citizen like myself can serve justice is to avoid or boycott the offender. This repository keeps track of the bad things I should boycott.


## What qualifies as injustice?

Different cultures and communities may have different definitions and interpretations of justice. However, there are certain values that every human should protect and foster, such as equality. That said, it is still difficult to clearly define injustice. Hopefully, the open-source nature of this document helps me to narrow that down and eventually reach a consensus.


## What kind of things are listed?

The things that are listed here have material evidence of reocurring injustice and a lack of punishment by the legal system.


## Why Github?

Github is mostly used for code sharing, but that is coincidental. I hope to leverage the following features `git` and Github provides:

* **Open** - Anyone can contribute, fork, or do whatever they want. The whole thing is transparent and open to public. If the original purpose of this document gets tainted or corrupt due to personal bias, anybody can fork and start their own list.
* **Commit history** - The things on this list could be revised or removed. The commit history can provide additional information about when and why certain things were revised or removed.
